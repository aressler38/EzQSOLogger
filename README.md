## Development Notes

* After building the dev container and starting the app, navigate to https://localhost:4280/ and https://localhost:3000/ to accept the self-signed certificates.

### Debugging

* In VS Code, run `Start App` first, and then you can run the `Chrome` launcher while `Start App` is running.
  This allows debugging the react app and the .net app all in VS Code.
