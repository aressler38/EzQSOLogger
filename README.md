## Development Notes

* After building the dev container and starting the app, navigate to https://localhost:4280/ and https://localhost:3000/ to accept the self-signed certificates.
* You can enable the Volar typescript server: https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#volar-takeover-mode
* If you change the tsconfig files, then you may also need to update the env.d.ts.

### Debugging

* In VS Code, run `Start App` first, and then you can run the `Chrome` launcher while `Start App` is running.
  This allows debugging the react app and the .net app all in VS Code.
